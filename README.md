Neural Network
==============

A feed-forward artificial neural network implementation with vectorized matrix operations.  
Uses the GNU Scientific Library (gsl) for matrix calculations.  
Features:
* neural network creation
* neural network destruction
* neural network training
* neural network prediction
* display matrix helper function
* array to matrix conversion helper function
