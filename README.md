Neural Network
==============

A feed-forward artificial neural network implementation with vectorized matrix operations.  
Uses the GNU Scientific Library (gsl) for matrix calculations.

Features:
* neural network creation
* neural network destruction
* neural network training
* neural network prediction
* display matrix helper function
* array to matrix conversion helper function

Parameters:
* neural network layers
* number of neural network layers
* learning rate
* random number range (neural network weights)
* number of training iterations (epochs)
